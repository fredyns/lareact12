# Enums

Add new Enum to [`EnumController`](../Http/Controllers/EnumController.php) to make it available via API and accessible for any js form.

**Note:** Enums are now automatically converted to TypeScript at build time. See the **[Complete Enums Guide](../../documentation/ENUMS.md)** for details on the compile-time generation system.
